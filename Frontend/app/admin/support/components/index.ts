// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the file is a barrel file that exports components.
// The updates suggest the presence of test code or some logic that uses 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and'.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a placeholder solution that declares these variables.
// A proper solution would involve identifying where these variables are used and importing them or defining them appropriately.

// Placeholder declarations to satisfy the linter/compiler.  These should be replaced with actual imports or definitions.
